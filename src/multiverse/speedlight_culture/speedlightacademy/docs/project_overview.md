# Speedlight Academy - Project Overview

## Vision
Speedlight Academy is a web platform designed to connect students and professors in the field of photography and editing. It serves as a learning hub where users can track their progress through courses and participate in community-driven competitions.

## Ecosystem Integration
**Speedlight Academy** is the educational pillar of the **Speedlight Culture** ecosystem. It operates in synchrony with the main platform to offer a comprehensive experience:
*   **Unified Account**: Potential for shared credentials between Culture and Academy.
*   **Synergy**: Users from Speedlight Culture are funneled to Academy for learning, and Academy graduates showcase their work (photos, builds) back on Culture.
*   **Domain**: Operates at `speedlightacademy.com` but remains visually and functionally linked to the generic Speedlight brand.

## User Roles
1.  **Student**:
    *   Can register and log in.
    *   Access to a personal Dashboard.

2.  **Professor**:
