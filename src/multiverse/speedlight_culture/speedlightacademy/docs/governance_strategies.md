# Governance & Quality Strategy

Strategies to mitigate risks regarding popularity, impartiality, and quality control.

## 1. Mitigating "Popularity vs. Quality"
*   **The Pre-Approval Gate**: The primary defense is the **Jury Pre-Approval**. By filtering submissions *before* they go public, we ensure that every photo in the voting phase has met a technical baseline. Even if a "popular" photo wins, it is guaranteed to be a *good* photo.
*   **Weighted Scoring**: The 30% Jury score is applied in the final tally. A photo with high popular votes but very low jury score will struggle to beat a photo with good popular votes and high jury score.

## 2. Ensuring Impartiality
*   **Blind Moderation**: In the Jury Panel, the author's name and profile picture are **hidden** during the approval/rejection phase. Jurors judge the image solely on its merit.
*   **Random Assignment**: Pending photos are distributed randomly among available jurors to prevent collusion.
*   **Conflict of Interest**: Jurors cannot moderate or vote on their own submissions (system enforced).

## 3. Operations: The Jury Panel
A specific interface for users with the "Juror" role.
*   **Queue View**: Grid of anonymous pending photos.
*   **Decision Tools**:
    *   ✅ **Approve**: Sent to Feed.
    *   ❌ **Reject**: Opens a modal with predefined reasons.
*   **Workload**: Gamified "Moderation Streaks" to encourage jurors to clear the queue.

## 4. Rejection & Feedback Loop
*   **Rejection Reasons**:
    *   "Low Quality / Blurry"
    *   "Wrong Category"
    *   "Inappropriate Content"
    *   "Duplicate / Spam"
*   **User Notification**: "Your photo was not accepted for [Category] because: [Reason]. Please try again."

## 5. Staff & Professor Verification
To ensure the quality of education, "Professor" status is not automatic.

*   **Application Process**:
    1.  User registers as a normal member.
    2.  Submits "Professor Application" via settings.
    3.  **Requirements**: Portfolio link, Bio, Areas of expertise.
*   **Validation**:
    *   **Manual Review**: The Admin team reviews the application.
    *   **Criteria**: Technical quality, teaching ability, or verified alliance status (e.g., instructor from Escuela Nacional Automotriz).
*   **Result**: Validated users get the "Professor" badge and access to create/manage courses.
