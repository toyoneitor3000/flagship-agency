# Automated Contest Workflow

## User Experience Flow

1.  **Discovery**:
    *   User visits the "Competitions" or "Convocatorias" section.
    *   Sees active calls (e.g., "Photo of the Week #42").
    *   **Instagram-Style Feed**: The core interface is a social feed. Users upload photos to their profile/feed first.
    *   **"Postulate" Action**: Users select a photo from their feed (or a new upload) and click "Postulate/Postular" to enter it into a contest.

2.  **Participation & Categories**:
    *   **Photo of the Week**: Open category. "The Best of the Week".
    *   **Photo of the Month**: Focused on the "Speedlight Community" vibe. Must be relevant to that month.
    *   **Photo of the Year (The 5 Pillars)**:
        1.  **High Speed (Action)**: Track, Drift, Rally. Capturing the motion.
        2.  **Stance & Design (Static)**: Showcasing the build, lighting, and lines of the car.
        3.  **Speedlight Lifestyle**: The culture, people, mechanics, and vibe behind the lens.

3.  **Jury Pre-Approval (The Filter)**:

    *   **Blind Review**: Jurors see the photo and categories but NOT the author's name to ensure **Impartiality**.
    *   **Action**:
        *   **Approve**: Photo is published to the Public Feed/Contest.
