# Potential Conflicts & Risks (FAQ)

Here are 5 probable doubts or conflicts that could arise from the current model:

1.  **Subjectivity vs. "Popularity Contest" (70/30 Rule)**
    *   *Conflict*: Since the public vote is 70%, valid technical photography might lose against "viral" or "influencer-driven" submissions where candidates ask all their followers to vote.
    *   *Mitigation*: How do we balance this? Should the Jury have a veto power or a distinct "Critic's Choice" award?

2.  **Jury Bias & Corruption**
    *   *Conflict*: Since Jurors are elected by popular vote, popular users (not necessarily the best technical judges) gets the power. What prevents them from voting for their friends?
    *   *Mitigation*: Anonymity in the judging phase or randomized jury pools?

3.  **Copyright & Image Sales**
    *   *Conflict*: If users can sell prints/images, does Speedlight Academy take a commission? Who owns the rights if an image is submitted to a contest and also sold?
    *   *Mitigation*: Clear Terms of Service regarding non-exclusive rights.

4.  **Spamming for Points (Gamification)**
    *   *Conflict*: Users might leave low-quality comments ("Nice", "Cool", "Wow") just to farm points for the gamification system.
    *   *Mitigation*: Minimum character limits or "Helpful" upvotes on comments required to earn points.

5.  **Multi-Category Postulation Quality**
    *   *Conflict*: Users might "spam" the same photo into ALL 5 annual categories even if it doesn't fit, just to increase chances.
    *   *Mitigation*: Should there be a "curation" or "approval" step before it appears in a specific category feed?
