# Design System

## Color Palette
The visual identity is anchored in a modern, dark, and vibrant aesthetic suitable for automotive and photography culture.

*   **Primary Blue**: `#003399` (Deep Technical Blue - "Blueprint" base).
*   **Primary Green**: `#66cc33` (Vibrant Racing Green / Chartreuse).
*   **Accent Yellow**: `#ffcc00` (Lightning Bolt Yellow - Warning/Action color).
*   **Gradient**: Distinctive Horizontal/Diagonal split or smooth blend between the Technical Blue and Racing Green.
    *   *Usage*: Hero sections, CTA buttons.
*   **Neutral**: White `#ffffff` for text.

## Typography
*   **Headings**: "**Speedlight**" Style - Wide, Geometric, Racing aesthetic (e.g., *Eurostile Extended*, *Microgramma*, or *Montserrat* with wide spacing). Looks "Fast" and "Technical".
*   **Body**: Clean sans-serif (e.g., *Inter* or *Roboto*).

## UI/UX Principles
*   **Blueprint Aesthetic**: Backgrounds featuring subtle technical drawings, grid lines, white notations, suspension schematics, and vector outlines of car parts.
*   **"Master Knowledge" Vibe**: The interface should feel like a high-tech dashboard or a telemetry screen.
*   **Card Styling**: Glassmorphism is still relevant, but with "HUD" (Heads-Up Display) elements—thin borders, corner accents.
*   **Imagery**: The user's photos are the hero. UI should frame them, not overpower them.
